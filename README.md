# YALF: Yet Another Linear Servo

project to build a linear servo for RC models.


## key project assumptions

* long move range
* digital position control
* digital feedback on current servo position
* 12V power supply (directly from battery)
* does not consume power when not moving, while still keeping position
* possible magnetic coupling with element moved
