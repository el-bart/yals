# TODO list

* update model from coupler to universal joint
* add between-bearing-support-blocks connector, to stiffen servo body
* add a carve out in linear potentiometed holder, to ensure it does not touch universal joint
* add end-stops (or otherwise guarantee never going out of bounds, as it stalls engine and permanently locks it, requiring manual intervention)
